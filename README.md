How It Works:
Functionality:

The calculate_discount function calculates the discounted price only if the discount is 20% or higher.
If the discount is less than 20%, it returns the original price.
User Interaction:

The user inputs the original price and the discount percentage.
Based on the inputs, the final price is calculated and displayed.
Edge Case Handling:

The try...except block ensures that invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) are handled gracefully.
